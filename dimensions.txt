thin-card.svg: 297mm x 210mm  (A4)

In panelised.svg, the squares are 160mm square;
                  the triangles are 193mm along the bottom
In thin-card.svg, the smaller squares are 52mm x 49mm
                  the larger square is 120mm across, with
                  a bounding box of 134mm square.

(Whether or not you include the width of the lines, as inkscape does,
 may affect the numbers slightly. Yes, I should have used a proper CAD
 program, but I only had this to hand at the time.)
